#MacOS Periodic Rotation of Apache Logs
## Usage
A shell script used by Mac OS's periodic (daily, weekly, monthly) maintenance system to rotate all logs in a given directory.

I created this to manage the Apache and PHP logs generated by my local dev hosting setup. (Setup as per https://echo.co/blog/os-x-1010-yosemite-local-development-environment-apache-php-and-mysql-homebrew .)

Steps:
1. Open "110.rotate-logs" in your favorite code editor.
  1. Edit the path to point to the directory containing the logs you want rotated.
  2. Edit the wildcard to match the log files. (e.g.: *.log, *_logâ€¦)
  3. Optional: edit the datestamp format.
  4. Save file and close.
2. Copy "110.rotate-logs" to /private/etc/periodic/monthly (or weekly, or daily)
3. Done.

Notes:
1. The 3 digit prefix on the filename seems only to indicate the execution order of scripts in the folder.
2. Multiple instances of this script can be run, one for each directory of logs you want rotated. Simply run through the Steps above.
  1. Rename the file as needed. "rotate-apachelogs", "rotate-lincolnlogs", whatever.
3. The new log files can be created with the same user and perms as the user running the script, and CHMODed as needed. Uncomment the "touch,chmod & chown" at line 30 and edit as you need.


Enjoy.
